        <div class="l">fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.
            Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular,
             have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and
              nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
              [1] Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output,
             and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</div>
